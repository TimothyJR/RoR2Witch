Witch Mod Character for Risk of Rain 2

The Witch has four sets of abilities. Each one revolves around an element that she controls. The four are fire, ice, wind, and lightning. Each element has a theme to it.

- Fire is about area of effect damage.
- Ice is about strong charging abilities.
- Wind is about fast mobile abilities.
- Lightning is about strong single target abilities.

The witch has an item, the Witch's Staff, which changes her abilities every 120 seconds. Everytime an ability is used, the timer is reduced by one second.

The witch uses a modded damage type for her lightning secondary skill, which causes a tesla like effect if it kills a target.
